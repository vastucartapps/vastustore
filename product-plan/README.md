# VastuCart Store — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement VastuCart Store — a premium e-commerce platform for spiritual and Vastu Shastra products.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (always provide with instructions)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined
- `instructions/incremental/` — 22 milestone instructions (shell + 21 sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, tokens
- `data-shapes/` — UI data contracts and combined type reference
- `shell/` — Application shell components (storefront, customer dashboard, admin dashboard)
- `sections/` — 21 section component packages with test specs

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Start with Shell (`instructions/incremental/01-shell.md`)
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
5. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Architecture Context

VastuCart is built on:
- **Backend:** Medusa v2 (open-source e-commerce)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (storefront + admin)
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) — shared auth across 12 ecosystem subdomains
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Deployment:** Coolify (single Docker Compose)
- **Payments:** Razorpay (India/INR) + Stripe (International/USD)
- **Auth:** Supabase — shared credentials, independent JWT sessions per app, RLS

## Testing

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with UI behavior test specs. Adapt to your testing setup.

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They prompt for important clarifying questions
- **Build incrementally** — Shell first, then customer-facing sections, then admin
- **The components are flexible** — They accept data and fire callbacks. Backend architecture is up to you.
